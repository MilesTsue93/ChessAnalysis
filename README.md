# ChessAnalysis
## Analysis of Chess.com games and users using Sentiment Analysis and Supervised learning
## What strategy to use to win?
Binary classification using win or loss condition as the target

### uses the data set club_games_data.csv from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajha1504/chesscom-user-games-60000-games

### for later:

* perhaps combine two chess datasets in a meaningful way (GM games and 60,000 general games)

# next, will set up an ML pipeline using kubeflow or soemthing simiklar, use an Chess.com API instead of one dataset and analyze the text to predict who wins.
